This project was undertaken to demonstrate proficiency in business intelligence and data visualization techniques. It involved connecting to data sources, shaping and transforming data, creating a relational data model, and visualizing insights using Power BI.

The pdf file and pbix is  uploaded because the dashboards were created using student account which did not have the publish option.

In this project, I played the role of Business Intelligence Analyst for AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company. 
My role was  to transform raw data into professional-quality reports and dashboards to track KPIs, compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.
