In this project, I conducted an analysis to investigate the relationship between various features in Youtube data. Leveraging data analytics techniques, I aimed to uncover insights into user engagement and content performance.
I carried out :
1.Sentiment Analysis
2.Word Cloud Analysis
3.Emoji Analysis.
I also tried to answer some basic questions about user engagement, relationship between views likes, impact of punctuations on views,etc.
Utilizing Python libraries such as pandas and seaborn, I conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationship between different featurtes in the datatset. Visualizations, including box plots, were generated to identify trends and outliers.
